# Python_Challenge
Module 3 challenge

There are two parts to this challenge. Part one is called PyBank and part two is called PyPoll. 
The purpose of part one of this challenge is to create a Python script that analyzes records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In part two, the dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate", and the challenge is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

Resources used to create this code include ChatGPT and the UC Berkeley AI Assistant.
